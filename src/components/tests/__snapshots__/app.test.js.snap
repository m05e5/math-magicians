      A mathemagician is a mathematician who is also a magician. The term "mathemagic"  is believed to have been introduced by Royal Vale Heath with his 1933 book "Mathemagic".[1]

        The name "mathemagician" was probably first applied to Martin Gardner, but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians, ncluding Arthur T. Benjamin,[2] Persi Diaconis,[3] and Colm Mulcahy.[4] Diaconis has suggested that the reason so many mathematicians are magicians is that "inventing a magic trick and inventing a theorem are very similar activities."[5]
